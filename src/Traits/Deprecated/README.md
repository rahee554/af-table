# DEPRECATED TRAITS

These traits have been moved to the Deprecated folder as they contain duplicate functionality or conflicting methods with newer unified traits.

## Deprecated Caching Traits (Superseded by HasUnifiedCaching)
- HasAdvancedCaching.php
- HasCaching.php  
- HasIntelligentCaching.php
- HasSmartCaching.php
- HasTargetedCaching.php

## Deprecated Optimization Traits (Superseded by HasUnifiedOptimization)
- HasEagerLoading.php
- HasMemoryManagement.php
- HasOptimizedCollections.php
- HasOptimizedMemory.php
- HasOptimizedRelationships.php
- HasQueryBuilder.php

## Deprecated Column Management Traits
- HasColumnOptimization.php (Superseded by HasBasicFeatures)
- HasColumnSelection.php (Superseded by HasColumnVisibility)
- HasDistinctValues.php (Superseded by HasUnifiedCaching)

## Deprecated Export/Utility Traits
- HasAdvancedExport.php (Property conflicts with HasBasicFeatures)
- HasExport.php (Basic version, use HasBasicFeatures)
- HasExportOptimization.php (Specialized, consolidated)
- HasFiltering.php (Basic version, use HasAdvancedFiltering)
- HasForEach.php (Superseded by HasBasicFeatures)

## Why These Were Deprecated
1. **Method Name Conflicts**: Multiple traits defining the same method names
2. **Duplicate Functionality**: Same features implemented in multiple places
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Too many overlapping traits
4. **Memory Usage**: Multiple caching layers causing inefficiency
5. **Unified Approach**: Replaced by comprehensive unified traits

## Recommended Replacements
- Use **HasUnifiedCaching** for all caching needs
- Use **HasUnifiedOptimization** for all performance optimizations
- Use **HasBasicFeatures** for core datatable functionality
- Use **HasColumnVisibility** for column management
- Use **HasAdvancedFiltering** for filtering capabilities

## Migration Path
If you were using any of these deprecated traits:
1. Remove the trait import
2. Use the recommended replacement trait
3. Update method calls if method names changed
4. Test thoroughly

These deprecated traits will be removed in a future version.
