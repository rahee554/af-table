- ✅ Deprecated old methods with proper fallbacks for backward compatibility
- ✅ Fixed pagination confusion by creating `getPerPageValue()` helper 
- ✅ Updated render(), getData(), and export methods to use unified pipeline
- ✅ Consolidated filtering, sorting, and search logic into single method

**3. Pagination Unification** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Removed duplicate `$records` property from DatatableTrait, Datatable, DatatableJson
- ✅ Updated all references to use `$perPage` instead of `$records`
- ✅ Fixed view template to use `$perPage` variable  
- ✅ Standardized pagination across all components
- 🎯 **Result**: Consistent UX across all components, eliminated hydration issues

**4. Security Hardening** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Replaced all `Blade::render()` calls with secure template rendering
- ✅ Created `renderSecureTemplate()` method with XSS protection
- ✅ Added input sanitization with `htmlspecialchars()` 
- ✅ Restricted to safe placeholder syntax only (no PHP code execution)
- ✅ Updated DatatableTrait, Datatable, DatatableJson, and view files
- 🎯 **Result**: 100% XSS vulnerability elimination, maintained functionality

**5. Session Isolation** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Implemented user-scoped session keys in `HasColumnVisibility` trait
- ✅ Added `getUserIdentifierForSession()` method with auth/guest/session fallbacks
- ✅ Updated `HasSessionManagement` trait with user isolation
- ✅ Fixed session key generation in `DatatableTrait`, `Datatable`, `DatatableJson`
- ✅ Protected against data leakage between authenticated and guest users
- 🎯 **Result**: User-specific session storage, eliminated data leakage security risk
