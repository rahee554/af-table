**Technical Debt**: Consider refactoring the main Datatable class into specialized traits to improve maintainability and testability as the feature set grows.

**Performance Considerations**: Monitor query performance as relationship complexity increases. Consider implementing relationship caching for frequently accessed nested data.

**Breaking Changes**: Future versions may introduce breaking changes for major architectural improvements. Maintain backward compatibility where possible and provide clear migration guides.

## 🎉 LATEST IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

**JSON Column Enhancement Completed Successfully!**

The AF-Table package now supports extracting specific values from JSON database columns with the following user experience:

```php
// Example: Form submission with JSON data column
@livewire('aftable', [
    'model' => 'App\Models\FormSubmission',
    'columns' => [
        ['key' => 'title', 'label' => 'Title'],
        ['key' => 'member_id', 'label' => 'YLP Member', 'raw' => '{{ $row->member_id ? "YLP Member" : "Not a member" }}'],
        ['key' => 'data', 'json' => 'name', 'label' => 'Name'],           // Shows only extracted name
        ['key' => 'data', 'json' => 'email', 'label' => 'Email'],         // Shows only extracted email  
        ['key' => 'data', 'json' => 'contact.phone', 'label' => 'Phone'], // Shows only phone number
        ['key' => 'status', 'label' => 'Status'],
    ],
    'actions' => [
        '<a href="/download/{{$row->id}}" class="btn btn-sm btn-primary">Download</a>'
    ]
])
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Extracted Values Only**: JSON columns show only the extracted value, not the full JSON data
- ✅ **Priority Processing**: JSON extraction takes precedence over other column types  
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient JSON column handling in SQL queries
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Clear "(JSON)" labels in table headers
- ✅ **Complete Documentation**: Updated README, code generator, and examples
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Files Updated:**
- `Datatable.php`: Enhanced SELECT logic and JSON extraction method
- `datatable.blade.php`: Priority JSON rendering and visual indicators
- `README.md`: Complete JSON column documentation with examples
- `index.html`: JSON path support in code generator
- `TODO.md`: Comprehensive feature tracking and codebase analysis

The package now handles all major column types efficiently: database columns, function columns, JSON columns, simple relations, and multi-level nested relations.

### Model Enhancements Completed

#### Enrollment Model Accessors Added:
```php
// ✅ All accessors working and tested
public function getUserNameAttribute()     // Gets student's user name
public function getUserEmailAttribute()    // Gets student's user email  
public function getCourseTitleAttribute()  // Gets course title
public function getUserAttribute()         // Direct user access
```

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Enrollment Page**: Student names display properly
- ✅ **Sorting**: All accessor-based columns sort correctly
- ✅ **Search**: Search functionality works on all columns
- ✅ **Error Prevention**: No more crashes on nested relation sorting
- ✅ **Performance**: Query performance improved with accessors

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ **README.md**: Added nested relationship section with limitations and solutions
- ✅ **Roadmap**: Created comprehensive 16-month development roadmap
- ✅ **Examples**: Provided working code examples for all patterns
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Clear guidance on when to use each approach

## 🚀 Next Phase: Advanced Nested Relationship Engine

### Roadmap Overview
- **Phase 1** (Current): ✅ COMPLETE - Immediate fixes and workarounds
- **Phase 2** (Q2 2025): Full nested relation sorting support
- **Phase 3** (Q3 2025): Advanced filtering and search for nested relations  
- **Phase 4** (Q4 2025): Unlimited nesting depth with optimization

### Immediate Benefits Achieved
1. **Stability**: No more application crashes
2. **Performance**: Better query efficiency with accessors
3. **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback on column capabilities
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more testable code structure
5. **Scalability**: Foundation for advanced nested relationship features

## 🎯 Recommendation for Production

**Use the accessor approach** for all nested relationship data:

1. **Create accessors** in your models for complex nested data
2. **Use simple relations** for basic one-level relationships  
3. **Avoid nested relation syntax** until Phase 2 implementation
4. **Monitor performance** with Laravel Debugbar
5. **Follow the roadmap** for upcoming advanced features

**Current Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All critical issues resolved, no blocking bugs

# TODO: Support for Array/Table Data Source in Datatable

## Feature Request

Add support for using the Datatable component with data passed as an array or collection (not Eloquent model). This will allow rendering all features (search, filter, sort, pagination, column visibility, etc.) when the data source is not a database model, but a custom array or a foreach loop in Blade.

## Proposed Features

- [ ] Accept array/collection data source (not just Eloquent model)
- [ ] Enable all existing features: search, filter, sort, pagination, export, column visibility, etc.
- [ ] Provide a new Livewire component (e.g., `DatatableArray` or `DatatableCustom`) for this use case
- [ ] Document usage and limitations in README
- [ ] Add examples for Blade foreach usage
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing Blade templates
- [ ] Add tests for array/collection data source


## Notes
- This will help users who want to use the datatable for API data, custom queries, or any non-Eloquent data source.
- Consider reusing logic from `DatatableJson` for array/collection support.
- Add clear documentation and migration guide for users.
